# NLP
For storing all the NLP code: 

Root:

-  |-----> data (all csv files go here but they're not uploaded because of gitignore, this keeps our scripts consistent)
-  |-----> examples (we put example code we want to use here)
-  |-----> nlp_platform (this is going to be our finalised scripts)
-  |-----> practice (a folder for keeping the notebooks and scripts we are working on)
